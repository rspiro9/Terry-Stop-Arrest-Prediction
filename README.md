# Module 3 Final Project - Terry Stop Arrest Prediction


## Purpose

Utilize database including information on Terry Stops for a classification analysis to predict if an arrest ended up being made as a final resolution to the police terry stop. This research can be used to help officers better prepare for what to expect during a terry stop based on certain variables that are present.


## Data Science Process Used

I leveraged the OSEMN (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, Interpret) process for this project. My notebook is organized to follow this process.

## The Dataset

Database containing information on every terry stop made by Seattle police officers (i.e. weapon type, if an arrest was made, reported date, officer precinct, etc.). A terry stop is when a police officer stops a person based on 'reasonable suspicion' that the person may have been involved in criminal activity.

## Key Questions Investigated:

1. Predict if an arrest is likely to occur as a result of a terry stop.
2. What features are most imprtant in predicting an arrest?
3. How can this research be used to improve police officer prepardness for terry stops?
